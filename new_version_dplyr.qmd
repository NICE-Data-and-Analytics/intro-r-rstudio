## Group by - in operation

The `summarise()` function currently relies upon the `group_by()` function to apply summary statistics to groups/sets but in a new release the reliance will be changed to be function specific. Currently code 

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2|3"
beds_data |> 
  group_by(date) |>
  summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av, 
                             na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
beds_data |> 
  summarise(mean_beds = sum(beds_av),
            .groups = c(org_code, org_name)
            )
```
