## R Scripts v RMarkdown/Quarto

::: incremental
- Scripts are very quick files of code with comments but RMarkdown and Quarto mix written text with code.

- Quarto is a newer version of RMarkdown (2022) and is very similar for R users

- Quarto allows the possibility of working with colleagues who use other languages like Python
:::

## Open a new Quarto file

<img src="img/session-quarto/open-file-quarto.png" alt="Screenshot of File/New File/Quarto Document..." class="center"/>

## Render

Will open up a wizard to force the file to be saved.

As Quarto produces an output file it must have rights to save to the location.


## Have a go!

1. Change the title and then render
1. Go to the bottom of the existing code and in Visual mode create a header `Introduction code` and add a small table
1. Change the view to Source from Visual
1. Click on the wheel icon next to Render and in that menu select Preview in `View Pane`
1. Render the qmd


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 8,
                     color_border = "#005EB8",
                     color_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_running_text = "white",
                     color_running_background = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_background = "white",
                     margin = "0.9em",
                     font_size = "2em")
```

## New code chunks

The default is for R chunks in R Studio but chunks can also be Python

Create a new R chunk either with the green button with a <img src="img/icons/notebook-insert-chunk.png" alt="A picture of the green square with c button from RStudio to create a new chunk"/> or using `Ctrl+Alt+i`

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

37+9

```

## Chunk options

Each `chunk` is a part of a longer script and needs to be run in order to render.

- **Switch off chunks**
To stop code running in any of the chunks code:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false

This will not run
```

:::incremental
- **Showing your code**
To include code in a report or presentation use `#| echo: true`
:::

## Have a go!

Let's try to show code in a report:

1. In the chunk you created for the SQL connection type at the top of the chunk `#| echo: true`
1. Render the script to see what that looks like in a report output.
1. Return to SQL connection string chunk and add `#| label = "arrange"`. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 7,
                     color_border = "#005EB8",
                     color_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_running_text = "white",
                     color_running_background = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_background = "white",
                     margin = "0.9em",
                     font_size = "2em")
```

## Table of contents

- A table of contents is built automatically in RStudio when headers are used.

:::incremental
- Accessed through the Outline icon in the top right of the Editor pane.

- Code chunks and headers together can be navigated from the bottom left of the Editor pane.
