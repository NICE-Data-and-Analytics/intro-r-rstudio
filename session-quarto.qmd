## R Scripts v RMarkdown/Quarto

::: incremental
- Scripts are very quick files of code with comments but RMarkdown and Quarto mix written text with code.

- Quarto is a newer version of RMarkdown (2022) and is very similar for R users

- Quarto allows the possibility of working with colleagues who use other languages like Python
:::

## Open a new Quarto file

<img src="img/session-quarto/open-file-quarto.png" alt="Screenshot of File/New File/Quarto Document..." class="center"/>

## Render

Will open up a wizard to force the file to be saved.

As Quarto produces an output file it must have rights to save to the location.


## Have a go!

1. Change the title and then render
1. Go to the bottom of the existing code and in Visual mode create a header `Introduction code` and add a small table
1. Change the view to Source from Visual
1. Click on the wheel icon next to Render and in that menu select Preview in `View Pane`
1. Render the qmd


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 8,
                     color_border = "#005EB8",
                     color_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_running_text = "white",
                     color_running_background = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_background = "white",
                     margin = "0.9em",
                     font_size = "2em")
```

## Code chunks

The code sections in Quarto (and RMarkdown) are called chunks  

These are like smaller R scripts  

## New code chunks

The default is for R chunks in R Studio but chunks can also be Python

- Create a new R chunk either with the green button with a <img src="img/icons/notebook-insert-chunk.png" alt="A picture of the green square with c button from RStudio to create a new chunk"/> 
- Using `Ctrl+Alt+i` 
- In Quarto Visual type `/` and a drop down menu will appear, R chunk is the first so press Return

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

37+9

```

## Chunk options

Each `chunk` is a part of a longer script and needs to be run in order to render.

- **Switch off chunks**
To stop code running in any of the chunks code:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false

This will not run
```

:::incremental
- **Showing your code**
To include code in a report or presentation use `#| echo: true`
:::

## Have a go!

Let's try to show code in a report:

1. Create an R code chunk and type a sum like `37 * 6`
1. In the chunk add r #| echo: false under the `{ r}` line and Render
1. Change the code to `true` and render

Extra time: Add another line for "r #| eval: false",  
Render, change to true and Render again

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 7,
                     color_border = "#005EB8",
                     color_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_running_text = "white",
                     color_running_background = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_background = "white",
                     margin = "0.9em",
                     font_size = "2em")
```

## Global options settings

The default {r} settings are for echo: true and eval: true. 

To switch these globally in YAML (yet another markup language):

```{yaml}
title: "My report"
format: html
execute:
    echo: true
    eval: true
```

## Self contained

To create an html output that can be emailed without a folder with images and libraries:

```{yaml}
title: "My report"
format: html
execute:
    echo: true
    eval: true 
embed-resources: true
```

## Table of contents
- Chunks can be named which makes them easier to navigate from the bottom left hand menu in the Editor.

:::incremental

- A table of contents based on just headers is built automatically in RStudio and can be switched on/off from the Outline icon in the top right of the Editor pane.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
# label: my-chunk-name
```
