## Projects

::: notes

The next session is about RStudio projects, which are a very nice, and highly recommended way of organising your files and code projects.

For those of you working with the Posit cloud - projects work very differently, so the slides and menus might not make sense, so you might just be as well listening along, then at the end if its useful I'll just show you how it works in Posit Cloud.

(check who is working in cloud vs desktop)

## Working Directory

If you tell R/R Studio to look for a file, or save a plot, it will (by default) look in a place called the working directory (wd)

<img src="img/session-projects/working-directory.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the tabs `Console/Terminal` and Jobs in RStudio and underneath the location of the workshop at ~" class="center"/>

::: notes

Before I show you how to setup projects, I'm going to back up a little and talk about a concept called the working directory.

The 'working directory' is where R assumes your files are saved, and where it looks when you refer to those files in your code. Each project you create gets it's own working directory.

You can see the current working directory by looking at this area in RStudio below the console and terminal tabs.

:::

## Change overall default Working Directory

Often defaults to the `Documents` folder but can be changed in `Tools/Global Options`

<img src="img/session-projects/change-wd.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the Tools/Global Options with the Default working directory box highlighted." class="center"/>

::: notes

The working directory often defaults to something like the 'Documents' folder. This isn't ideal, but there isn't an obvious default I would unhesitatingly recommend. If you want to change it you can amend it in Tools/Global options and under the 'General' tab, then you can select the default working directory you want.

:::

## Bookmarks

A Project can make it easier to find tell your session where to get files from and where to save them but, like bookmarks, you can:

::: incremental
-   share this location with others
-   move between projects easily
:::

::: notes

OK, so having dealt with that, lets's talk about the benefits of projects. As well as the obvious one of keeping your work separate, clean and tidy, working in projects makes it easier for you to share projects with others, and also move between projects yourself without getting overwhelmed with clutter and not knowing where things are.

## Project menu

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 1

</br> <img src="img/session-projects/project-list.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the specific project menu from the top right area of RStudio" class="center"/>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 2

</br> <img src="img/session-projects/project-wizard.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the project wizard when new Project... selected" class="center"/>
:::
:::

::: notes

Let's create a project now. One way of doing this is to click the drop down in the top right, with the R in the little cube. If you do this, you'll get options to create a new project, close a project, and if you've been using projects in the past, the last 5 you've used will be visible here to switch to. Your project list will probably be blank, which is what we'd expect.

To create a new project, you can click on the new project option. You can also do this through the file menu, which gets you to the same screen, which looks like this (on the right). Then click 'New Directory'

(check everyone ok before flicking to next slides)

## Project Type and Name wizards

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 3

</br> <img src="img/session-projects/project-type.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the project type list starting with New Project but includes R Package and Shiny Application" class="center"/>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 4

</br> <img src="img/session-projects/project-name.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the project name wizard where the location can also be changed" class="center"/>
:::
:::

::: notes

Then click just 'New Project' (top option), and you'll get through to this screen (show step 4), where you can give your project a directory name. It will be created as a subdirectory below (you can amend this if you wish).

Having completed a directory name and reviewed the parent directory, you can click 'create project' and it'll set it up

(demo what is looks like now with a test project)

## Browsing in RStudio

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Click the three dot icon in the bottom right quadrant, Files tab:
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
<img src="img/session-projects/wd-files.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the Files tab with the three dot button highlighted, the words Click to open and explorer type browser is on the image."/>
:::
:::

::: notes

Once you've completed a project, the files pane will change to the new project location, together with the files at that location. If you need to browse to another location, you can do so by clicking the three little dots in the top right of the files pane, then you'll get a box that pops up that allows you to change the folder the pane is showing.

:::

## Getting back to the working directory

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
First way:

Click the grey arrow next to the file pathway `~/` in the Console

</br> <img src="img/session-projects/working-directory.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the working directory name and grey arrow found in the Console."/>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Second way:

Once a project has been created an R hex logo appears in the Files tab next to the three dots

<img src="img/session-projects/r-link-wd.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the Files tab with the R hex icon next to the three dots highlighted."/>
:::
:::

::: notes

To get back to the working directory, you can either click the grey arrow next to the file pathway in the console, or click on the R in the cube in the top right of the file pane.

## End session

That's the end
