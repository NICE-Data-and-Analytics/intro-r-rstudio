## Projects

## Working Directory

If you tell R/R Studio to look for a file, or save a plot, it will (by default) look in a place called the working directory (wd)

Often defaults to the "Documents" folder but can be changed in Tools/Global Options

## Bookmarks

A Project can make it easier to find tell your session where to get files from and where to save them but, like bookmarks, you can:

::: incremental
-   share this location with others
-   move between projects easily
:::

## Project menu

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 1

::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 2

## Project Type and Name wizards

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 3

Step 4

## Have a go! *Not for the RStudio Cloud*

1.  Create a project in an existing folder using the Project menu.  
2.  Note the name of the `.Rproj` file that is generated automatically.  
3.  Create a new project, this time choosing the selection `Shiny Application`. What files are created?
4.  Using the Project menu move between the two projects.

Extra: Delete one of the `.Rproj` files and then try to select it from the menu. What happens?

## Browsing in RStudio

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Click the three dot icon in the bottom right quadrant, Files tab:
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Getting back to the working directory

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
First way:

Click the grey arrow next to the file pathway `~/` in the Console

</br> <img src="img/session02/working-directory.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the working directory name and grey arrow found in the Console."/>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Second way:

Once a project has been created an R hex logo appears in the Files tab next to the three dots
