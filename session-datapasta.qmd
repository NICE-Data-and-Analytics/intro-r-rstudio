## Text data

It can happen where someone emails a small table that you need in R.

There is a way to copy it to create a dataset directly in R using [{datapasta}](https://milesmcbain.github.io/datapasta/).

As an addin it only needs to be loaded and run once:

```{r}

library(datapasta)
```

## Add ins

## Have a go!

Using a small table from the [NHS Workforce statistics statistics](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest#:~:text=Main%20facts%20and%20figures%20around%201.3%20million%20people,22.1%25%20were%20from%20all%20other%20ethnic%20groups%20combined) open the [csv file for number and percentage of NHS staff by ethnicity](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest/downloads/by-ethnicity.csv) 1.Highlight the table, including the column names and copy (Ctrl+C)
2.  Select the `Addins/Paste as tribble`
3.  Run the code using the `Run` button or Ctrl+Enter anywhere in the code

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10,
                     color_border = "#005EB8",
                     color_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_running_text = "white",
                     color_running_background = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_background = "white",
                     margin = "0.9em",
                     font_size = "2em")
```

## A data frame in code

```{r}
tibble::tribble(
  ~Ethnicity, ~`%`, ~Headcount, ~`%.working.age.population.(2011)`,
     "Asian",   10,     118396,                                7.2,
     "Black",  6.1,      72321,                                3.4,
   "Chinese",  0.6,       6536,                                0.9,
     "Mixed",  1.7,      20607,                                1.8,
     "White", 79.2,     934544,                               85.6,
