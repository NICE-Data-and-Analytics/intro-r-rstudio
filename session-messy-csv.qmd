## Importing a csv that needs tidying

```{r}
#| label: "libs"
#| include: false
library(readr)
```

```{r }
#| label: "load-data"
beds_data <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/main/beds_data.csv"), 
                      col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%d/%m/%Y")), 
                      skip = 3)
```

### Exploring Mental Health (MH) Inpatient Capacity

The following is some analysis of Mental Health inpatient capacity in England.

### Background

Maintaining clinical effectiveness and safety when a ward is fully occupied is a serious challenge for staff. 

Inappropriate out of area placements have an added cost and also mean patients are separated from their social support networks.

## The Data

KH03 returns (bed numbers and occupancy) by organisation, published by NHS England.  

Scraped from the [NHSE statistics](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/bed-availability-and-occupancy/bed-data-overnight/
) website which is partially cleaned

A good point to say that are [Government data standards](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/area_of_work/accessibility/) to make spreadsheets and charts accessible. 

## Importing a messy dataset

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Click on the file `beds_data.csv` in the Files pane (bottom right) and then `Import Dataset...`
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Cleaning in the wizard

It's a common issue to have blank metadata and blank lines at the top of spreadsheets

<img class="center" src="img/session06/beds-data-wizard-2.png" alt="Screenshot of the beds_data.csv data in the import wizard with the Title and Source rows highlighted." />

## Skip rows

<img class="center" src="img/session06/beds-data-wizard-skip.PNG" alt="Screenshot of where to skip rows in the import wizard. In this case skip 3 rows so the column headers appear at the top of the preview."/>

Move the cursor to another area to update the view immediately.

## Dates may be a problem

<img class="center" src="img/session06/beds-data-wizard-date.png" alt="Screenshot again with one more thing to fix: Click on the drop down menu by the column called date."/>

## Default US dates on UK data

## Final data

```{r}
beds_data
```
