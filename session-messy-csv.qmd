## Importing a csv that needs tidying

```{r}
#| label: "libs"
#| include: false
library(readr)
```

```{r }
#| label: "load-data"
beds_data <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/main/beds_data.csv"), 
                      col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%d/%m/%Y")), 
                      skip = 3)
```

### Exploring Mental Health (MH) Inpatient Capacity

The following is some analysis of Mental Health inpatient capacity in England.

### Background

Maintaining clinical effectiveness and safety when a ward is fully occupied is a serious challenge for staff. 

Inappropriate out of area placements have an added cost and also mean patients are separated from their social support networks.

::: notes

We're going to take some beds data, for example because we're interested in looking at occupancy rates and how full these beds are.

:::

## The Data

KH03 returns (bed numbers and occupancy) by organisation, published by NHS England.  

Scraped from the [NHSE statistics](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/bed-availability-and-occupancy/bed-data-overnight/
) website which is partially cleaned

::: notes

Specifically, this data is from the KH03 bed return published by NHS England, which show organisation bed numbers by quarter. It's taken from the website but not as nicely formatted as it might be

:::

## Accessible spreadsheets

This is a perfect opportunity to say that are [Government data standards](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/area_of_work/accessibility/) to make spreadsheets and charts accessible.

::: notes

If you are interested in how best to format spreadsheets to make people's life easier, there are standards you can look at - link will be available after the session with the slides.

:::

## Importing a messy dataset

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Click on the file `beds_data.csv` in the Files pane (bottom right) and then `Import Dataset...`
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
<img class="center" src="img/session06/beds-data-wizard.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the import wizard with the beds_ae.csv data populating it. Notice that something isn't right."/>
:::
:::

::: notes

We're going to look at importing this data, which is the beds_data.csv file in the folder shared with you already. 

So if you try the import wizard approach as before, you'll get this windo popping up (demo)

:::

## Cleaning in the wizard

It's a common issue to have blank metadata and blank lines at the top of spreadsheets

<img class="center" src="img/session06/beds-data-wizard-2.png" alt="Screenshot of the beds_data.csv data in the import wizard with the Title and Source rows highlighted." />

::: notes

and what you'll see is that there is some metadata at the top which means R can't find the headers, which are a few rows down.

:::

## Skip rows

<img class="center" src="img/session06/beds-data-wizard-skip.PNG" alt="Screenshot of where to skip rows in the import wizard. In this case skip 3 rows so the column headers appear at the top of the preview."/>

Move the cursor to another area to update the view immediately.

::: notes

What you want to do here is enter a number in the skip box, and click out somewhere innocuous, and it'll update (demo)

:::

## Dates may be a problem

<img class="center" src="img/session06/beds-data-wizard-date.png" alt="Screenshot again with one more thing to fix: Click on the drop down menu by the column called date."/>

::: notes

We also need to check the columns types are correct... H

Here we have a date field formatted as a character, rather than a date

:::

## Default US dates on UK data

<img class="center" src="img/session06/beds-data-date-wizard.PNG" alt="Screenshot of a wizard pop up to change the date format to %d/%m/%Y."/>

::: notes

typically we'd also need to change the date format to the UK day month year format rather than the US month day year format. You might also need to change text to 'character', numeric to double or integer. In general, readr is pretty good at automatically detecting the most appropriate type.

and if you do that...

(demo import)

:::

## Final data

```{r}
beds_data
```

::: notes

you should end up with something that looks like this....

pause for questions.

:::

## End session

::: notes

one last thing to cover today, and that's direct import from a url
