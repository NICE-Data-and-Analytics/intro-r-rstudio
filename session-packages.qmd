## Packages

Quotations in R can be either double or single quotes but cannot be mixed or omitted:

```{r}
# either
install.packages("tidyverse")

# or
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

will download a package to your personal library (quotes can be used)

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
```

tells R to load the package from your personal library and is needed for every new session/script

::: notes
On work computer networks the packages get saved to personal files on C: drives so are not accessible to everyone

Good practice to detail what you use in the script, RStudio will pick up references to packages not yet loaded (on CRAN)

Delete unused packages

## Package locations

### CRAN repository

[Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)

18,903 packages (April 2022). Free. Peer reviewed.

### GitHub

Many useful packages in development or subject to a lot of change are not on CRAN and are available through GitHub including [{NHSRtheme}](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRtheme). These won't be peer reviewed.

### ROpenSci

ROpenSci offer a peer reviewed ecosystem of R packages through GitHub including UKHSA's [{fingertipsR}](https://github.com/ropensci/fingertipsR)

## {tidyverse}

Curly brackets around a {package} is used in text as many packages have "real names"

## What is the {tidyverse}?

The [tidyverse package](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collects (some of) the most popular\
R packages into one.

Also refers to a coding style in R.

## {tidyverse} debate

Should you use {tidyverse} when many of the packages are redundant?

Clashes occur with the packages which you are notified about, but not with those outside the package

    -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------ tidyverse 1.3.0 --
    v ggplot2 3.3.3     v purrr   0.3.4
    v tibble  3.1.0     v dplyr   1.0.4
    v tidyr   1.1.2     v stringr 1.4.0
    v readr   1.4.0     v forcats 0.5.1
    -- Conflicts --------------------------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
    x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

## Errors, warnings & notifications

Warnings - not errors, just information on versions

    Warning messages:
    1: package ‘tidyverse’ was built under R version 4.0.4 
    2: package ‘tidyr’ was built under R version 4.0.3 
    3: package ‘readr’ was built under R version 4.0.3 
    4: package ‘purrr’ was built under R version 4.0.3 
    5: package ‘dplyr’ was built under R version 4.0.3 
    6: package ‘stringr’ was built under R version 4.0.3 

Don't rely upon colour changes as all three are orange in the console!

## Install and load packages

The wizard in RStudio for all of these CRAN packages is in the `Packages` tab in the bottom right or

```{r}
install.packages(dplyr)
install.packages(datapasta)
install.packages(usethis)

# or in one line
# install.packages(c("dplyr", "datapasta", "usethis"))

library(dplyr)
library(datapasta)
library(usethis)
```
